Any support is _greatly_ appreciated, but donations are *not* and will *never* be necessary to use my software!

(I also have a [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/akemin_dayo) page, but I would prefer you only use that if you _must_ for some reason, because transactions processed through Ko-fi have a fee deducted from them and can sometimes even be delayed.)
