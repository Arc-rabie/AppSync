# Important information regarding the Dopamine jailbreak

There is a known IPC (inter-process communication) issue with Dopamine that prevents apps from successfully installing.

It may also cause the TrollStore app to become temporarily unusable.

To restore TrollStore functionality, open your persistence helper (such as "GTA Car Tracker") and select "Refresh App Registrations".

If that does not help, perform a userspace reboot using the Dopamine app, or via the command line using `launchctl reboot userspace` or `ldrestart`.
