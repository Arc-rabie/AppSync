# Cydia/Zebra/Sileo/etc. is telling me to uninstall Substituteâ€¦!? What does this mean?

This means you are using an outdated version of Substitute. Please update your version of Substitute (and/or your jailbreak app of choice).

For unc0ver, Substitute version **0.0.13 or HIGHER** will work. (This Substitute version is also bundled with unc0ver app version **v3.7.0~b3 or HIGHER**.)

Additionally, **please make sure you are NOT using a forked unc0ver app (such as the "abortive" version, which ships a broken Substitute under the ID `science.xnu.substitute`).** I cannot guarantee any compatibility with these versions.

For Chimera or Electra, Substitute version **0.1.1-coolstar or HIGHER** will work.

# Unified AppSync dynamic library for iOS 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.

* AppSync Unified is **NOT** for piracy.

* AppSync Unified is for **freedom of iOS development with the official Xcode iOS SDK.**

* Jailbreaking is **NOT** for piracy.

* Jailbreaking is for **freedom of your iOS device.**

AppSync Unified is a tweak that patches `installd` to allow for the installation of unsigned, fakesigned, or ad-hoc signed IPA packages on an iOS device.

AppSync Unified can be used to downgrade or clone installed apps, to download fakesigned IPAs (often emulators), and also to assist in the development of iOS applications using Xcode.

**AppSync Unified should not be used to pirate iOS apps. Please support iOS app developers and do not pirate!**

**I explain the problem with AppSync Unified and iOS piracy rather thoroughly [in this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/3oovnh/discussion_regarding_appsync_unified_ios_9_and/). Please give it a read.**
