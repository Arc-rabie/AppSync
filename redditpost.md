AppSync Unified is a tweak that patches `installd` to allow for the installation of unsigned, fakesigned, or ad-hoc signed IPA packages on an iOS device.

AppSync Unified can be used to downgrade or clone installed apps, to download fakesigned IPAs (often emulators), and also to assist in the development of iOS applications using Xcode.

**AppSync Unified should not be used to pirate iOS apps. Please support iOS app developers and do not pirate!**

**I explain the problem with AppSync Unified and iOS piracy rather thoroughly [in this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/3oovnh/discussion_regarding_appsync_unified_ios_9_and/). Please give it a read.**
