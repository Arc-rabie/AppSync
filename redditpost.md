Any support is _greatly_ appreciated, but donations are *not* and will *never* be necessary to use my software!

(I also have a [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/akemin_dayo) page, but I would prefer you only use that if you _must_ for some reason, because transactions processed through Ko-fi have a fee deducted from them and can sometimes even be delayed.)

# Changelog for 68.0 ([full changelog](https://cydia.akemi.ai/?page/net.angelxwind.appsyncunified-changelog))

* Minor update that resolves an edge case where users using the Meridian jailbreak on iOS 10 (which uses Substitute and _not_ Substrate) would be unable to install AppSync Unified due to an oversight in the dependency resolution logic.

* No other changes were made to AppSync Unified's functionality or code.

* Thanks to Jacqueline for notifying me of this bug and for testing the new dependency resolution logic on her Meridian device!

# Unified AppSync dynamic library for iOS 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13.

* AppSync Unified is **NOT** for piracy.

* AppSync Unified is for **freedom of iOS development with the official Xcode iOS SDK.**

* Jailbreaking is **NOT** for piracy.

* Jailbreaking is for **freedom of your iOS device.**

AppSync Unified is a tweak that patches `installd` to allow for the installation of unsigned, fakesigned, or ad-hoc signed IPA packages on an iOS device.

AppSync Unified can be used to downgrade or clone installed apps, to download fakesigned IPAs (often emulators), and also to assist in the development of iOS applications using Xcode.

**AppSync Unified should not be used to pirate iOS apps. Please support iOS app developers and do not pirate!**

**I explain the problem with AppSync Unified and iOS piracy rather thoroughly [in this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/3oovnh/discussion_regarding_appsync_unified_ios_9_and/). Please give it a read.**
